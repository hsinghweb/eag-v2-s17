The user wants a concise Markdown report containing Apple's current stock price. I need to format the value from `current_apple_stock_price` into a Markdown string. Assuming `current_apple_stock_price` will be an array containing a string that represents the stock price (e.g., `["AAPL: $170.50 USD"]`), I will construct a simple Markdown heading followed by this stock price information.
